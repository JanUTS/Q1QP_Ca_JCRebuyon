            Household income and total food expenditure are pivotal metrics in assessing the economic stability of a
             family unit. Understanding the correlation between earnings and the corresponding allocation towards 
             sustenance is a focal point of this research endeavor. Through a meticulous analysis of a dataset 
             comprising 50 households, the researchers aim to unveil insights into this relationship.
              The dataset encapsulates essential demographic information, encompassing regional affiliations 
              and distinct sources of income, further segmented into categories such as wages, entrepreneurial 
              endeavors, and other avenues of revenue. It is worth noting that although the data was not 
              originally derived from surveys, it underwent rigorous categorization by the project's proponents.
               This dataset originates from the Philippine Statistics Authority, collected as part of the national
                census for income and expenditures (Flores, 2017).

            The sampling methodology employed in this study adheres to the principles of simple random sampling. 
            This method entails the unbiased selection of proponents from population data obtained from reputable '
            online sources. A fundamental concept in statistical analysis, sample size, is defined by the Institute
             for Work & Health (2008) as the total number of participants or observations within a given dataset or
              study. In the context of this investigation into family household income and total food expenditure,
               the sample size stands at a precise count of 50. The primary focus of this study is directed towards
                families that not only generate income but also allocate a portion towards their sustenance through 
                food expenditure.

            By delving into this relationship, the researchers seek to shed light on the financial 
            dynamics that influence household well-being. Analyzing income distribution vis-Ã -vis food
             expenses offers valuable insights into economic priorities and potential areas for financial
              planning and support. The meticulous categorization of income sources, including wages and 
              entrepreneurial activities, provides a nuanced understanding of the diverse financial avenues
               available to households. Additionally, regional distinctions within the dataset may reveal regional
                variations in economic behaviors and priorities. This study serves as a testament to the 
                multidimensional nature of economic well-being, emphasizing the complex interplay between 
                income generation and allocation for essential needs.

            Furthermore, the utilization of data sourced from the Philippine Statistics Authority bolsters
             the credibility and reliability of the findings, as it is collected as part of a comprehensive
              national census. This robust data source lends depth and authority to the study's conclusions 
              and implications. The inclusion of identifiable information, such as region and income sources, 
              allows for a comprehensive contextualization of the findings within the broader socio-economic 
              landscape. This holistic approach enables the researchers to discern potential patterns and trends
               that may influence household economic behaviors.
